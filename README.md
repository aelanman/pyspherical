Implements the fast spin-weighted spherical harmonic transform methods of McEwan and Wiaux (2011) [1],
and evaluates Wigner little-d functions using the recursion relations of Trapani and Navaza (2006) [2]. Transforms are
supported for any spherical sampling pattern with equally-spaced samples of azimuth at each latitude (iso-latitude sampling).
Additional functions are provided to evaluate spin-weighted spherical harmonics at arbitrary positions.

These methods are implemented entirely in Python, taking advantage of numba jit compilation and numpy vector operations
for speed.

## Dependencies
* `numpy`
* `numba`
* `scipy`

Optionally, for tests:
* `sympy`
* `pytest`

## Installation

`pyspherical` may be installed by cloning the repository and running setup.py:
```
> git clone https://github.com/aelanman/pyspherical.git
> python setup.py install
# or
> pip install .
```

## Quick Start

Tests can be run using `pytest` to confirm that the installation was successful.

An example script `scripts/example_1.py` demonstrates how to use some of the available evaluation and transform functions. Another script `scripts/example_2.py` plots the spherical harmonics for el < 4. Further documentation is under development.
